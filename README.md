Learning Objectives
------------------- 
Suppose we have a client who wants to deploy Cassandra-based system on clouds. Cassandra is distributed NoSQL database for big data processing. The client has information of concurrent users, like from 160 to 320 concurrent users, from previous business experiences. However, the client does not know which cloud service provider would be good for the client, how many servers would be required, what kind of server type would be required. The client also wants to know estimated performance and cost of using clouds. Those information is important to make cost-effective business decisions before migrating to or adopting clouds.

Goal
----
1.	Learn how to launch cloud servers on different cloud service providers, such as Google cloud and Microsoft cloud, in addition to Amazon cloud.
2.	Learn how to let multiple cloud servers communicate.
3.	Compare and analyze cloud service providers in terms of performance and cost by using Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark.

Expected Outcomes
------------------
1.	Launching multiple cloud servers on Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Service.
2.	Launching Cassandra cluster on each cloud service provider and benchmark results.
3.	Comparing and analyzing cloud service providers by using benchmark results.
